# Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my data analysis portfolio.  
This repository highlights projects across **Python and SQL** that demonstrate my ability to ingest messy data, clean and normalize it, perform quantitative analysis, and deliver clear, decision-ready outputs.

Each project simulates real-world analytical workflows with and shows the full pipeline: **data ingestion → transformation → tiering/aggregation → visualization/export**.
Note, these project samples are modified/adapted accordingly to exclude sensitive, classified data from the actual projects completed at my job.

## Project Samples

### Python Project 1 — NIBRS Incident Analysis
**Goal:** Analyze U.S. crime incident data and standardize it into meaningful state-level metrics.  
**What I did:**  
- Cleaned and normalized raw CSVs (NIBRS + Census).  
- Computed incident rates per 100,000 residents.  
- Built state leaderboards and year-over-year comparisons.  
- Produced visualizations to highlight key trends.  
**Key Skills:** Data wrangling, normalization, merging external datasets, exploratory visualization.

### Python Project 2 — Airline Delay Drivers
**Goal:** Identify what factors most influence flight delays and cancellations.  
**What I did:**  
- Preprocessed large airline flight datasets.  
- Engineered temporal and categorical features.  
- Trained and evaluated classification models.  
- Ranked feature importance and summarized operational insights.  
**Key Skills:** Feature engineering, machine learning modeling, interpretability, business insight generation.

### SQL Project 1 — Retail Analytics (Cohorts + RFM)
**Goal:** Understand customer retention and value in a retail environment.  
**What I did:**  
- Created purchase cohorts and measured retention.  
- Performed RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation.  
- Labeled customer groups such as “high-value” or “at-risk.”  
**Key Skills:** SQL cohort analysis, segmentation logic, query optimization.

### SQL Project 2 — HR Analytics (Window Functions)
**Goal:** Support workforce planning with employee tenure and performance data.  
**What I did:**  
- Computed tenure buckets and department averages.  
- Used window functions (`RANK()`, `AVG() OVER`) for performance analysis.  
- Built views to feed into HR reporting dashboards.  
**Key Skills:** Window functions, ranking, tenure analytics, SQL reporting views.
