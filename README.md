# ðŸ“Š Data & Research Portfolio

Welcome! This repository is a collection of projects that demonstrate my skills in **data analysis, visualization, research, and technical problem solving**. My background combines **physics** and **research & analysis (RAND)**, giving me a unique perspective on applying analytics across domains. Note, these project samples are modified/adapted accordingly to exclude sensitive, classified data from the actual projects completed at my job.
